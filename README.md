# ST558-Project3

Author: Peter Scarbrough

In this project, an analysis dashboard is presented for the analysis of superconductor material data. Data was obtained through the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis dashboard provides a summary of the data and the dashboard features and it allows for the visualization, summary, modeling, and prediction of the data. Results from figures, data, and predictions may be saved using the dashboard. 

Several robject files are uploaded to the github repository. These are machine learning models which are loaded into dashboard to speed dashboard loading time significantly. 

With the `shiny` library installed in R, the dashboard may be loaded through an R console with the following command:  

shiny::runGitHub("ST558-Project3", "ScarbroughPeter")

Note it may take one minute to download the file and run the dashboard due to the size of the modeling objects.
